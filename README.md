# AMMO

Almost Manual Mod Organizer

A Simple Terminal-Based Mod Organizer for Linux

## Supported Games

- Starfield
- Skyrim
- Skyrim SE
- Oblivion
- Fallout 4
- Enderal
- Enderal Special Edition

## AMMO vs Manual

- AMMO only:
  - FOMOD install wizard.
  - Ability to return to vanilla game state easily.
  - Load order management, including activation / deactivation.
- AMMO and Manual:
  - No dependency checking or automated load order handling.
  - No Nexus integration. Manual downloads only.
- Manual only:
  - Even minor mistakes are catastrophic.
  - Returning to vanilla requires nuke/pave/reinstall.

## Dependencies

- Games installed through Steam
- Steam is either distro version or from Flatpak com.valvesoftware.Steam
- Python3
- p7z (or something else that puts 7z in your PATH).

## Installation Instructions

Steam Deck users:

```sh
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Everyone:

```sh
echo 'PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
git clone https://github.com/cyberrumor/ammo
cd ammo
pip3 install -r requirements.txt || pip3 install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
pip3 install . || pip3 install --break-system-packages .
```

You can now execute ammo with the terminal command `ammo`.

## Updating Instructions

```sh
cd /path/to/ammo/clone/dir
git pull
pip3 install --force-reinstall . || pip3 install --break-system-packages --force-reinstall .
```

## Usage Instructions

`ammo` - Launch the interactive shell. Select a game via index if prompted.

| commit      |                                       | Apply pending changes |
| configure   | \<index>                              | Configure a fomod |
| deactivate  | mod\|plugin \<index>                  | Disabled components will not be loaded by game |
| delete      | mod\|download \<index>                | Removes specified file from the filesystem |
| exit        |                                       | Quit |
| find        | [\<keyword> ...]                      | Show only components with any keyword |
| help        |                                       | Show this menu |
| install     | \<index>                              | Extract and manage an archive from ~/Downloads |
| move        | mod\|plugin [from_index] [to_index]   | Larger numbers win file conflicts |
| refresh     |                                       | Abandon pending changes |
| rename      | mod\|download \<index> \<name>        | Names may contain alphanumerics and underscores |

Note that the `de/activate mod|plugin` command now supports `all` in place of `<index>`.
This will activate or deactivate all mods or plugins that are visible. Combine this
with the `find` command to quickly organize groups of components with related names.

### Usage Tips and Tricks

- Note that the `de/activate mod|plugin` command supports `all` in place of `<index>`.
  This will activate or deactivate all mods or plugins that are visible. Combine this
  with the `find` command to quickly organize groups of components with related names.
  You can leverage this to automatically sort your plugins to the same order as your
  mod list:

    ```sh
    deactivate mod all
    # sort your mods with the move command
    activate mod all
    activate plugin all
    commit
    ```

- The `find` command accepts a special `fomods` argument that will filter by fomods.

- The `find` command allows you to locate plugins owned by a particular mod, or mods
  that have a particular plugin. It also lets you find mods / plugins / downloads via
  keyword. This is an additive filter, so more words equals more matches.

- You can easily return to vanilla like this:
  
  ```sh
  deactivate mod all
  commit
  ```

- If you don't know how many components are in your list and you want to move a
  component to the bottom, you can throw in an arbitrarily large number as the
  `<to index>` for the `move` command, and it will be moved to the last position.
  This only works for the `move` command.

- If you have several downloads and you want to install all of them at once, simply
  `install all`.

- Combining `find` filters with `all` is a great way to quickly manage groups of
  related components, as the `all` keyword only operates on visible components.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository, make changes on your fork, then open a PR. Below are some key guidelines to follow for code contributions, but keep in mind the intended scope of AMMO; it is NOT a download manager or API client and it does NOT launch programs.

- Format patches with ruff or black.
- Python only.
- Standard lib imports only.
- Unix filesystems only.
- Single threaded.
- Offline.
- No databases.
- No deamons.
- Testable without the UI.
- Installs mod files via symlink.
- UI is terminal based only.

### Tips and tricks for contributors

You can run tests from the base directory of the repo with `pytest test`.

It may be useful in your iterations to automate UI input before you've written
tests. I find the easiest way to do this is with this sort of strategy:

```sh
(echo "command1 arg1"; echo "command2 arg1") | ammo
```

If you need to recreate a complex set of initial steps then supply manual input,
you can use input redirection:

```sh
(echo "instruction1"; echo "instruction2"; cat <&0) | ammo
```

## Technical Details

AMMO works via creating symlinks in your game directory pointing to your mod files

### Why Symlinks?

- The configured state is discovered via file inspection and logic. This avoids
  entire classes of bugs that organizers relying on databases must contend with.
- Vast reduction in code and test complexity.
- It's easy to identify which mod provides a particular file.
- We can return to vanilla game state by simply unlinking all symlinks then
  removing empty folders. This actually occurs every time you commit, which
  provides a plethora of benefits also.
- They consume an insignificant amount of storage.
- They make it possible to use external tools that rely on mod data without
  coupling ammo to those tools.
